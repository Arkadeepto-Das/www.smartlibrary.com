To all the bookworms out there, we are here to build an app to help them create their own virtual library.

Among the tons of books available on various genres, one can build a stack of books on a wishlist, add books to the queue, and sort books on various categories, authors, groups, and years of publication.

Create an application using proper OOPS concepts, subtle codes, proper coding standards, and CSS to build the app.


### Application Flow:

1. The front page of the app will have a login form with username and password fields. Registration is not required. Maintain a table for user credentials along with their role (admin or reader).

2. (For Readers) Once successfully logged in, the user is taken to the account overview page, which has the following details:

a. The user's full name.

b. Continue reading (a list of books that are being read currently).

c. Items on the bucket list (books waiting to be read)

d. A home button to redirect to the homepage.

3. (For Admins) Redirect to a form to add book details: alphanumeric book ID, poster image, book title, genre, date of publication, author, ratings, and category. One book's data is to be added at a time. Insert the data into the table(s).

4. The home page will have a logout icon, a wishlist icon, and a bucket list icon.

5. Filters for sorting books by title in ascending or descending order.

6. Below this will be a list of books in multiple genres. At a time, nine books are loaded using AJAX when the "load more" button is clicked.

7. To display the books, show a thumbnail of the book, the book title, the author, and a button to add or remove the book from the bucket list.

8. If the publication date of a book is in the future, the book should get added to the wishlist, which is another container apart from the bucket list.

9. On click of the logout button, the user is redirected to the login form.

10. Use proper CSS to present the app.
